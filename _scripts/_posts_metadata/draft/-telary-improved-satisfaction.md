# How Telary Improved Client Satisfaction Using Researca: A Case Study

In today’s fast-paced business landscape, client engagement has become a critical factor in the success of consulting companies. Whether clients are browsing a proposal or deep into a complex consultation process, keeping them informed and engaged is the key to retaining their trust and maintaining satisfaction levels. Telary, a forward-thinking consulting company, recognized this challenge and turned to **Researca**, a powerful knowledge management tool, to transform how they manage information and communicate with clients.

In this case study, we’ll explore how Telary successfully improved their client satisfaction rates by using Researca. We’ll highlight the strategies they used, the challenges they overcame, and the measurable benefits that came from adopting this tool. More importantly, we’ll uncover how Researca’s features helped Telary improve client engagement at crucial stages of their consulting process.

## Understanding Telary’s Client Engagement Challenges

Telary is an agency helping mid-sized businesses navigate data challenges. From scaling operations to optimizing workflows, Telary’s services are highly customized to meet the needs of each client. With such a tailored approach, effective communication becomes a significant part of their service delivery.

One of the major challenges Telary faced was ensuring client engagement across the entire contract process. Typically, Telary operates within a **pre-signature phase** and a **post-signature phase**:

- **Pre-signature phase**: This is where clients evaluate Telary’s services, negotiate terms, and engage in discussions about their potential business needs.
- **Post-signature phase**: Once the deal is signed, Telary dives into the actual consulting work.

While Telary had a strong consulting model, they struggled to maintain consistent client engagement in the **pre-signature phase**, which often led to delayed contracts or clients dropping off entirely. They needed a better way to ensure continuous communication and provide value early in the relationship-building phase.

## The Role of Knowledge Management in Consulting

Consulting, by nature, is a knowledge-intensive business. Clients come to Telary for their expertise, but expertise alone isn't enough—**efficient management of information** is equally crucial. This is where **knowledge management tools** come into play.

Telary needed a way to manage vast amounts of data—from industry insights to tailored business recommendations—and deliver this information to clients in a way that kept them engaged and confident in the value they were receiving. The more efficiently Telary could collect and share relevant information, the more likely their clients would remain engaged throughout the process.

__But traditional methods of managing information—manual emails, disjointed communication threads, and inconsistent document sharing—were proving insufficient. The inefficiencies were leading to missed opportunities to engage clients at key decision points. This is when Telary decided to adopt **Researca** as their knowledge management platform.__

## Why Telary Chose Researca

__Researca stood out to Telary because of its ability to **centralize information** and present it in a way that is accessible, organized, and customizable. The platform allowed Telary to harness the power of real-time data aggregation and deliver highly relevant insights to their clients. However, unlike other traditional knowledge management tools, Researca allowed for a seamless user experience with features specifically designed to boost client engagement.__

Here’s what Researca offered that helped Telary overcome its challenges:

1. **Centralized Information Sharing**: Instead of sifting through multiple emails and attachments, Telary could deliver all necessary information to their clients through a single, organized channel.
2. **Personalized Client Dashboards**: Researca allowed Telary to create customized dashboards for each client, where they could access reports, industry news, and tailored insights related to their business needs.
3. **Collaborative Features**: Clients could leave comments, ask questions, and engage with Telary directly on the platform, making it easier to maintain ongoing conversations.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: One of the most critical features was real-time updates. Whether new market data or internal business reports became available, Researca ensured that Telary’s clients were always informed without the need for a manual push from Telary’s consultants.
5. **Data-Driven Insights**: Through Researca’s analytics capabilities, Telary could provide clients with actionable data and insights, adding significant value to the conversations and helping clients make informed decisions.

## Implementing Researca: The Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Mapping Client Touchpoints

Before adopting Researca, Telary first mapped out the critical **client touchpoints** during both the pre-signature and post-signature phases. This included identifying when and how clients typically interacted with Telary, such as during proposal reviews, strategy meetings, and the drafting of business plans.

With these touchpoints in mind, Telary created a strategy for how Researca would integrate into their workflow. The goal was simple: provide **relevant, timely information** at each of these points to maintain client engagement.

### Step 2: Customizing Client Dashboards

Once the touchpoints were identified, Telary’s consultants began working on creating customized **client dashboards** within Researca. These dashboards acted as a hub of information tailored to each client’s specific industry, market, and business needs.

Each dashboard contained:
- **Real-time data feeds** that were relevant to the client’s industry.
- **Consulting documents** such as proposals, timelines, and reports.
- **Communication tools** that allowed clients to interact directly with Telary consultants through comments and feedback on the platform.

### Step 3: Streamlining Internal Collaboration

Internally, Researca also played a critical role in improving how Telary’s teams collaborated. Instead of fragmented internal communication, consultants could now access shared resources, knowledge bases, and client information through a unified platform.

This internal use of Researca helped ensure that **everyone on the team was aligned** on client objectives, which led to more cohesive and informed client communications.

### Step 4: Engaging Clients with Real-Time Insights

One of the most significant improvements Telary made to their client engagement strategy was delivering **real-time insights** through Researca. With access to live data feeds, clients could see up-to-date market trends and reports directly on their dashboards, keeping them engaged without needing to ask for updates.

This proactive approach resulted in clients feeling more in control and connected to the consulting process, ultimately improving satisfaction.

## How Researca Boosted Client Engagement in the Pre-Signature Phase

### 1. Providing Value Early in the Process

One of Telary’s key pain points was ensuring that clients stayed engaged during the pre-signature phase. With Researca, Telary found an effective solution: providing potential clients with **exclusive, tailored content** that demonstrated the firm’s expertise early on.

By setting up dashboards even for prospects, Telary offered **free access to personalized market insights**, allowing clients to get a taste of the value Telary could bring to their business. This not only helped potential clients see the advantages of signing a contract but also established a sense of partnership early in the process.

### 2. Encouraging Client Interaction

Researca’s interactive features allowed potential clients to **ask questions directly within the platform**, eliminating delays caused by back-and-forth emails. This streamlined communication made clients feel more engaged, and they were able to get answers to their questions faster, improving their overall experience with Telary’s services.

### 3. Increasing Trust and Transparency

By providing access to real-time updates and data, Telary demonstrated a level of transparency that few consulting firms offer. Clients could see exactly where they stood in terms of deliverables, market changes, and strategic recommendations, which gave them confidence in Telary’s abilities.

This increased trust helped Telary close deals faster, as clients felt assured that they had all the information they needed to make informed decisions.

## Post-Signature Engagement: Keeping Clients Informed and Satisfied

### 1. Continuous Value Delivery

Once the contract was signed, Telary used Researca to **continuously provide value** throughout the engagement. Clients received real-time updates, and dashboards were regularly refreshed with new insights and progress reports. This made clients feel like they were always in the loop, even when complex projects were underway.

### 2. Smoother Project Collaboration

Researca’s collaborative features proved invaluable during the project delivery phase. Clients and Telary consultants could interact directly through the platform, making it easier to track progress, share documents, and discuss next steps without relying on email chains. This level of collaboration helped ensure that all stakeholders remained aligned and engaged.

### 3. Analytics-Driven Recommendations

Through Researca’s analytics capabilities, Telary was able to deliver **data-driven recommendations** that provided immediate value to their clients. Instead of relying solely on intuition or qualitative assessments, Telary could now back their strategic advice with hard data, which clients appreciated.
