Researca may be a bit complex but it's important to understand how you can freely manage the way you get your new knowledge, in this post I will try to explain how I use Researca and what is my "optimized" way of setuping the tool.

# Domains

Usually I go with 1 domain per really broad topic. For example I want to stay up to date professionnaly on tech topics:

* Data engineering
* Tech ecosystem
* Django
* Python
* Some web frameworks

But I also want to stay up to date, on some personnal finance, investigative journalism orgs and I enjoy gardening and sustainability blogs.

So I would go with the following domains:

* Data engineering
* Tech (Frameworks, Cloud Platforms....)
* Personal Finance (Sub reddits, Blogs)
* Journalism (Belling cat...)
* Nature (Sustainability, Gardening, Outdoor leisure...)

This would help me to have some dedicated spaces for each of my interest.

Once the domains are created you can select each on and click on the discover button to get started with the prepared bundles

# Bundles

For the Data engineering part I would use the following Bundles (each bundle stays grouped together).

* Data Engineering
* Data Vendors
* Data
* Airflow

For the tech domain I would use:

* Big Tech companies
* Tech
* Django News
* WebTech

For the other domain, there are no bundles prepared yet, so I will use the browser extension to remember all the cool site I visit, this way on my next connection to Researca I will be able to add it to a group.

# Conclusion

Researca is here to help you, and not become a source of stress or of doom scrolling, it's better to have small and constrained domains than to include very broad source and get an endless stream of things to read. At any time you can remove a website if you're not satisfied of it, even if you added it via the bundle feature.
